@page index Welcome!

In this website you will find documentation about the base styles and components 
library used for the Vintage Shop.

**A few things to note:**
- The Vintage Shop is built using DoneJS, an awesome open source JavaScript framework 
that makes it super easy to build high performance, real time web and mobile apps. 
Head here for more info: [https://donejs.com/](https://donejs.com/).
- The app also uses [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) as a CSS framework. Inside of your project folder under `src/styles.less` you can see how Bootstrap is imported and overwritten with customizations.
- If you want to edit this page or other `@pages` like this, head to `src/base/markdown` inside of your project folder.
